          <strong> <p>
                MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary
                JSON). Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB uses collections and
                documents, making it highly suitable for applications that require fast, scalable, and dynamic data
                storage.

                Each document in MongoDB is a JSON-like object, which can contain nested fields and arrays, allowing for
                complex data structures to be stored easily. A group of documents is stored in a collection, similar to
                a table in SQL.
                MongoDB is commonly used in modern web and mobile applications, especially in combination with Node.js
                in the MERN or MEAN stacks. Its a great choice for projects requiring real-time analytics, content
                management, IoT, and more.

                Would you like to see an example of how to connect MongoDB with Node.js or another use case?
