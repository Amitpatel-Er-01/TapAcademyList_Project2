                SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate
                relational databases. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data—commonly known as CRUD
                operations—within database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and SQL Server.

                SQL works with tables, which are made up of rows (records) and columns (fields). Each table typically
                has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row.
                SQL is essential for backend development, data analysis, and database administration. Understanding SQL
                is also important when working with ORMs like Sequelize (Node.js), Hibernate (Java), or Django ORM
                (Python).
