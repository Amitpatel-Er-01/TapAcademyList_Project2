                Spring is a powerful, open-source framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. It provides
                a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java applications, especially useful for
                developing web and backend services. At its core, Spring promotes dependency injection (DI) and
                aspect-oriented programming (AOP), which help in building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable
                code.

                One of the most popular modules of Spring is Spring Boot, which simplifies the setup and development of
                new Spring applications by minimizing boilerplate configuration and enabling fast, production-ready
                development. Spring Boot allows developers to create stand-alone applications with embedded servers like
                Tomcat or Jetty, making deployment easy.
