                JavaScript has become popular for backend development due to several reasons:

                Unified Language: Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend development allows for code
                reusability, as developers can share code between the client and server. This reduces development time
                and effort, streamlining the development process and making maintenance easier.
                Asynchronous Nature: JavaScript's asynchronous programming model allows backend applications to handle
                multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the execution thread. This means that while one task is
                waiting for I/O operations (like reading from a database or making an API call), the application can
                continue executing other tasks, leading to better performance and responsiveness.
                Vibrant Ecosystem: JavaScript has a vast and vibrant ecosystem with a plethora of libraries, frameworks,
                and tools tailored for backend development. Frameworks like Express.js and Koa.js provide robust
                features for building web servers and APIs, while libraries like Mongoose facilitate interaction with
                databases, enhancing developer productivity and accelerating development cycles.
                Node.js: The introduction of Node.js made JavaScript suitable for server-side development by providing a
                runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
