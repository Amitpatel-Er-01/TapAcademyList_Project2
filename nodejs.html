            <strong><p>
                Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run
                JavaScript code outside of the browser, typically on the server side. Built on Google Chromeâ€™s V8
                JavaScript engine, Node.js is known for its fast execution and non-blocking, event-driven architecture,
                making it ideal for building scalable and high-performance applications. It is commonly used for
                developing backend services such as RESTful APIs, real-time applications like chat apps, and even
                command-line tools. With the help of npm (Node Package Manager), developers can easily integrate
                thousands of libraries and modules, speeding up development and enabling the creation of powerful,
                feature-rich applications. Node.js is often paired with frameworks like Express.js to simplify routing,
                middleware management, and API creation, making it a popular choice for full-stack development,
                especially in combination with frontend technologies like React, Angular, or Vue.
